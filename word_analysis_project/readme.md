### Scope Statement for Content Evaluation Application Project

**Project Title:** Content Evaluation Application for MS Word Documents

#### **Project Objective:**

To develop an application that analyzes a set of Microsoft Word documents, assesses their content types, and generates scores based on predefined content criteria, within a 14-week timeframe incorporating a prototype phase.

#### **Project Deliverables:**

1. **Prototype Development (Weeks 1-4):**

    - A basic prototype demonstrating the core functionality of uploading and analyzing MS Word documents.

    - Initial content type detection and scoring features, limited to a small set of documents.

2. **Application Interface:**

    - User-friendly interface for ongoing document uploads and management.

    - Enhanced dashboard displaying analysis results and scores, based on feedback from the prototype phase.

3. **Content Analysis Engine:**

    - Finalized algorithm to accurately determine content types (e.g., reports, letters, essays) of documents.

    - Comprehensive scoring system to evaluate documents against specified criteria (e.g., relevance, completeness, clarity).

4. **Reporting Features:**

    - Generation of detailed reports summarizing content analysis and scores.

    - Export functionality for reports in various formats (PDF, CSV).

5. **Documentation:**

    - User manual detailing application features and usage instructions, updated post-prototype feedback.

    - Technical documentation to support future enhancements and maintenance.

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**

    - Comprehensive testing approach, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing, post-prototype and final application.

#### **Project Exclusions:**

- Support for file formats other than MS Word (.doc, .docx) will not be included.

- Analysis of multimedia content (images, audio) within documents is outside the project scope.

- Integration with external databases or other applications is excluded.

#### **Assumptions:**

- Users will have the necessary hardware and software to run the application efficiently.

- The project will have access to a representative set of MS Word documents for testing and prototyping.

- Clear content criteria will be provided by stakeholders for scoring purposes.

#### **Constraints:**

- The application must be completed within the 14-week timeframe, broken down into a clear schedule for prototype and full development phases.

- Budget limitations may restrict the scope of advanced features during the development process.

#### **Stakeholders:**

- Project Sponsor: [Name]

- Project Manager: [Name]

- Development Team: [Names and Roles]

- End Users: [Target User Groups]

#### **Success Criteria:**

- Successful development and deployment of the application by the end of the 14 weeks, fulfilling all specified requirements.

- Positive user feedback with satisfaction ratings of at least 80% based on usability and functionality, especially after the prototype phase.

- Accuracy of content type detection and scoring validated through testing results from both the prototype and final product evaluations.
